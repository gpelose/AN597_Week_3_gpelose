This is the code for my  [Homework02](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/homework-02.html) assignment 

First, do I need to install and packages for my homework?


The first question asks:

>Every Saturday morning, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest to listen for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number of calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session.

Question 1: 


```{r}

```
